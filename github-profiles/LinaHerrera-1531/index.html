    <h1>I'm Lina M Herrera</h1>
    <a href="https://github.com/lherrer5">My GitHub profile</a>
    <p>Business Administrator with more than 12 years of experience in different sectors and positions that require a
        good <strong>english</strong> level.
        I found my passion in technology, thatâ€™s why I am currently studying <strong>software development</strong> and
        test automation.
        My goal is to be able to join a company where I can give my best and continue learning from this wonderful
        world.
        I have skills such as teamwork, detail and achievement orientation, resourcefulness, method, curiosity, problem
        solving, among others,
        that I apply in everything I do.
        <br>
        Thanks for your understanding and support.
